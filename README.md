Improving HTML and CSS code for a website:

Issues:

1. The overuse of div tags.

2. Using ul tags to organize anchors in the header, making the code complex.

3. Giving unique classes to each component, making the code harder to read and the CSS longer.

Solutions:

1. Use semantic elements such as header, main, section, nav, aside, and footer to replace most divs. These elements express the purpose of different components clearly and help browsers read the code better. Use divs to organize anchors instead.

2. Use reusable classes for components with the same styling. For example, instead of having separate classes for "search-engine-optimization", "online-reputation-management", and "social-media-marketing", all of them can be grouped under a single class.

3. Reorganize attributes and group styles that share the same properties, instead of repeating them individually.

After the changes, the refactored page should have a more streamlined appearance.
